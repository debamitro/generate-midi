# generate-midi

So far this program does nothing but generate a single-track MIDI file
out.mid which has a very tiny phrase from the raaga Yaman.

It is structured as a small class 'MidiFile' which can be
used to create a single-track MIDI file from a series of
Indian classical notes and durations.
